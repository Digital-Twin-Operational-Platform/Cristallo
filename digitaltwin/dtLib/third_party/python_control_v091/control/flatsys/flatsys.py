# Flat system class (for use as a base class)
class FlatSystem(NonlinearIOSystem):
    """Base class for representing a differentially flat system.

    The FlatSystem class is used as a base class to describe differentially
    flat systems for trajectory generation.  The output of the system does not
    need to be the differentially flat output.

    Parameters
    ----------
    forward : callable
        A function to compute the flat flag given the states and input.
    reverse : callable
        A function to compute the states and input given the flat flag.
    updfcn : callable, optional
        Function returning the state update function

            `updfcn(t, x, u[, param]) -> array`

        where `x` is a 1-D array with shape (nstates,), `u` is a 1-D array
        with shape (ninputs,), `t` is a float representing the currrent
        time, and `param` is an optional dict containing the values of
        parameters used by the function.  If not specified, the state
        space update will be computed using the flat system coordinates.
    outfcn : callable
        Function returning the output at the given state

            `outfcn(t, x, u[, param]) -> array`

        where the arguments are the same as for `upfcn`.  If not
        specified, the output will be the flat outputs.
    inputs : int, list of str, or None
        Description of the system inputs.  This can be given as an integer
        count or as a list of strings that name the individual signals.
        If an integer count is specified, the names of the signal will be
        of the form `s[i]` (where `s` is one of `u`, `y`, or `x`).  If
        this parameter is not given or given as `None`, the relevant
        quantity will be determined when possible based on other
        information provided to functions using the system.
    outputs : int, list of str, or None
        Description of the system outputs.  Same format as `inputs`.
    states : int, list of str, or None
        Description of the system states.  Same format as `inputs`.
    dt : None, True or float, optional
        System timebase.  None (default) indicates continuous
        time, True indicates discrete time with undefined sampling
        time, positive number is discrete time with specified
        sampling time.
    params : dict, optional
        Parameter values for the systems.  Passed to the evaluation
        functions for the system as default values, overriding internal
        defaults.
    name : string, optional
        System name (used for specifying signals)

    Notes
    -----
    The class must implement two functions:

    zflag = flatsys.foward(x, u)
        This function computes the flag (derivatives) of the flat output.
        The inputs to this function are the state 'x' and inputs 'u' (both
        1D arrays).  The output should be a 2D array with the first
        dimension equal to the number of system inputs and the second
        dimension of the length required to represent the full system
        dynamics (typically the number of states)

    x, u = flatsys.reverse(zflag)
        This function system state and inputs give the the flag (derivatives)
        of the flat output.  The input to this function is an 2D array whose
        first dimension is equal to the number of system inputs and whose
        second dimension is of length required to represent the full system
        dynamics (typically the number of states).  The output is the state
        `x` and inputs `u` (both 1D arrays).

    A flat system is also an input/output system supporting simulation,
    composition, and linearization.  If the update and output methods are
    given, they are used in place of the flat coordinates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    flatsys : FlatSystem object
        Description of the differentially flat system.  This object must
        define a function `flatsys.forward()` that takes the system state and
        produceds the flag of flat outputs and a system `flatsys.reverse()`
        that takes the flag of the flat output and prodes the state and
        input.

    timepts : float or 1D array_like
        The list of points for evaluating cost and constraints, as well as
        the time horizon.  If given as a float, indicates the final time for
        the trajectory (corresponding to xf)

    x0, u0, xf, uf : 1D arrays
        Define the desired initial and final conditions for the system.  If
        any of the values are given as None, they are replaced by a vector of
        zeros of the appropriate dimension.

    T0 : float, optional
        The initial time for the trajectory (corresponding to x0).  If not
        specified, its value is taken to be zero.

    basis : :class:`~control.flatsys.BasisFamily` object, optional
        The basis functions to use for generating the trajectory.  If not
        specified, the :class:`~control.flatsys.PolyFamily` basis family
        will be used, with the minimal number of elements required to find a
        feasible trajectory (twice the number of system states)

    cost : callable
        Function that returns the integral cost given the current state
        and input.  Called as `cost(x, u)`.

    constraints : list of tuples, optional
        List of constraints that should hold at each point in the time vector.
        Each element of the list should consist of a tuple with first element
        given by :class:`scipy.optimize.LinearConstraint` or
        :class:`scipy.optimize.NonlinearConstraint` and the remaining
        elements of the tuple are the arguments that would be passed to those
        functions.  The following tuples are supported:

        * (LinearConstraint, A, lb, ub): The matrix A is multiplied by stacked
          vector of the state and input at each point on the trajectory for
          comparison against the upper and lower bounds.

        * (NonlinearConstraint, fun, lb, ub): a user-specific constraint
          function `fun(x, u)` is called at each point along the trajectory
          and compared against the upper and lower bounds.

        The constraints are applied at each time point along the trajectory.

    minimize_kwargs : str, optional
        Pass additional keywords to :func:`scipy.optimize.minimize`.

    Returns
    -------
    traj : :class:`~control.flatsys.SystemTrajectory` object
        The system trajectory is returned as an object that implements the
        `eval()` function, we can be used to compute the value of the state
        and input and a given time t.

    Notes
    -----
    Additional keyword parameters can be used to fine tune the behavior of
    the underlying optimization function.  See `minimize_*` keywords in
    :func:`OptimalControlProblem` for more information.
