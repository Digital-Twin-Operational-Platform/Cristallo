        Python Control Systems Library
        ==============================
        
        The Python Control Systems Library is a Python module that implements basic
        operations for analysis and design of feedback control systems.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Linear input/output systems in state-space and frequency domain
        - Block diagram algebra: serial, parallel, and feedback interconnections
        - Time response: initial, step, impulse
        - Frequency response: Bode and Nyquist plots
        - Control analysis: stability, reachability, observability, stability margins
        - Control design: eigenvalue placement, linear quadratic regulator
        - Estimator design: linear quadratic estimator (Kalman filter)

        Dependencies
        ============
        
        The package requires numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.  In addition, some routines
        use a module called slycot, that is a Python wrapper around some FORTRAN
        routines.  Many parts of python-control will work without slycot, but some
        functionality is limited or absent, and installation of slycot is recommended
        (see below).  Note that in order to install slycot, you will need a FORTRAN
        compiler on your machine.  The Slycot wrapper can be found at:
        
        https://github.com/python-control/Slycot
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Conda and conda-forge
        ---------------------
        
        The easiest way to get started with the Control Systems library is
        using `Conda <https://conda.io>`_.
        
        The Control Systems library has been packages for the `conda-forge
        <https://conda-forge.org>`_ Conda channel, and as of Slycot version
        0.3.4, binaries for that package are available for 64-bit Windows,
        OSX, and Linux.
        
        To install both the Control Systems library and Slycot in an existing
        conda environment, run::
        
          conda install -c conda-forge control slycot
        
        Pip
        ---
        
        To install using pip::
        
          pip install slycot   # optional; see below
          pip install control
        
        If you install Slycot using pip you'll need a development environment
        (e.g., Python development files, C and Fortran compilers).
        
        Distutils
        ---------
        
        To install in your home directory, use::
        
          python setup.py install --user
        
        To install for all users (on Linux or Mac OS)::
        
          python setup.py build
          sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        Code
        ----
        
        You can check out the latest version of the source code with the command::
        
          git clone https://github.com/python-control/python-control.git
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        You can run the unit tests with `pytest`_ to make sure that everything is
        working correctly.  Inside the source directory, run::
        
          pytest -v
        
        or to test the installed package::
        
          pytest --pyargs control -v
